 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       3.031   TIME= 16:01:30
 The data for *GET entity NODE item CPS and NODE= 8269 is not defined.   
  The *GET command is ignored.                                           

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       3.172   TIME= 16:01:30
 Element shape checking is currently inactive.  Issue SHPP,ON or         
 SHPP,WARN to reactivate, if desired.                                    

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       3.391   TIME= 16:01:30
 Contact element 17020 is missing DOF VOLT (and possibly others) of      
 underlying base element 4571.  Similar mismatches may exist elsewhere,  
 but checking for this is discontinued.                                  

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       3.422   TIME= 16:01:30
 Maximum contact stiffness 6.933262946E+17 is too big which can cause an 
 accuracy problem, you may scale the force units in the model.           

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       3.422   TIME= 16:01:30
 Minimum contact depth 3.951963197E-07 is too small which can cause an   
 accuracy problem, you may scale the length units in the model.          

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       5.359   TIME= 16:01:32
 Coefficient ratio exceeds 1.0e8 - Check results.
